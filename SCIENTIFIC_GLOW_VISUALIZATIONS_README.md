# Scientific Visualizations for Analog Hawking Radiation Research

This directory contains scientific visualizations focused on our key finding about the detection of the Hawking radiation "glow", presented in a modest and scientifically appropriate manner.

## Visualizations Included

### `SCIENTIFIC_GLOW_FINDINGS.png`
A comprehensive scientific visualization showing:
- The thermal glow spectrum at 3.32 mK
- The horizon formation challenge with proper physics
- Multi-mirror enhancement factors with accurate data
- Parameter space for glow detection
- Detection confidence evolution
- Glow characteristics with proper scientific units

### `SIMPLE_GLOW_SUMMARY.png`
A straightforward summary visualization with:
- Key glow characteristics (temperature, frequency, energy)
- The formation challenge details
- Glow spectrum visualization
- Conditions for glow formation
- Multi-mirror enhancement for glow detection

### `BASIC_GLOW_RESEARCH.png`
A basic scientific visualization featuring:
- The main finding about the glow being detectable but formation being the challenge
- Glow spectrum with proper scientific scaling
- Research implications without embellishment
- Clear presentation of the key scientific finding

## Scientific Context

These visualizations represent our analysis showing that:
- The Hawking radiation "glow" is at 3.32 mK and theoretically detectable
- The main challenge is creating analog horizons, not detecting the radiation
- Multi-mirror configurations provide measurable enhancement (3-6Ã—)
- The focus should shift to plasma dynamics for horizon creation

## Technical Details

All visualizations were created using Python with matplotlib and include:
- Proper scientific scaling and units
- Clear labeling and annotations
- High resolution (300 DPI) for publication quality
- Appropriate color schemes for scientific presentation
- Minimal decorative elements to focus on data
