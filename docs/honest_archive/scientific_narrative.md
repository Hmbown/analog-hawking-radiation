# The Horizon Hunter's Toolkit

## Crafting Laboratory Black Holes

Behind every laser pulse lies a question: *Can we bottle the universe's most mysterious boundary?*

This framework doesn't simulate black holes—it engineers conditions where physics itself whispers secrets about spacetime. We're not chasing cosmic drama; we're pursuing the subtle moment when plasma flow becomes a one-way street for information.

### The Art of Detection

The signal we're hunting isn't thunderous—it's a thermal whisper buried in radio noise, a temperature difference measured in millionths of a degree. Our toolkit transforms this impossible measurement into a calculated probability, giving experimentalists the vocabulary to design campaigns that might actually succeed.

### Professional Precision

Every threshold, every uncertainty propagation, every validation check serves one purpose: ensuring that when someone claims to see Hawking radiation in a laboratory, the physics community listens.

This isn't about cosmic grandeur. It's about methodological rigor so thorough that skepticism becomes curiosity.
