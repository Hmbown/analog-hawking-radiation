Glossary (Plain Language)
=========================

- Analog Hawking radiation
  - Laboratory systems (like flowing plasmas or fluids) that mimic black‑hole horizons. Where the flow speed crosses the local signal speed, a “sonic horizon” forms and thermal‑like radiation is predicted.

- Horizon (sonic horizon)
  - The point/region where the flow speed |v| equals the signal (sound) speed c_s. Upstream signals cannot cross downstream through the horizon.

- Surface gravity (κ)
  - A measure of how sharply the horizon is “pulled tight” (gradient at the horizon). In this project, κ sets the characteristic thermal scale of the Hawking‑like spectrum.

- Hawking temperature (T_H)
  - The effective temperature associated with κ: T_H = ħ κ / (2π k_B). Higher κ → higher temperature.

- Graybody transmission
  - Real systems are not perfect blackbodies; near‑horizon scattering suppresses some frequencies. A “graybody” transmission multiplies the ideal spectrum to model this.

- Power spectrum density (PSD)
  - How much power appears at each frequency (W/Hz). We integrate PSD over a band to get total power in that band.

- Radiometer equation and 5σ time (t5)
  - A radio‑detection rule of thumb: SNR = (T_sig/T_sys) √(B t). Solving for SNR = 5 gives t5. If the signal temperature T_sig doubles, time drops by ~4×.

- Plasma mirror / hybrid model
  - A model where a moving reflective structure couples to the horizon, potentially enhancing the signal. This repository treats it as an exploratory, model‑dependent extension.

- Pareto frontier
  - A set of configurations where you can’t improve one objective (e.g., higher temperature) without worsening another (e.g., longer detection time).
