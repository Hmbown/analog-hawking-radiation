## Detailed Test Results

### 1. Data Flow Testing

#### Plasma Models → Horizon Detection
- **FluidBackend** successfully produces plasma states with density, velocity, and sound speed profiles
- **Horizon detection** correctly identifies horizon positions and calculates surface gravity (κ)
- Output structure validation confirms all expected fields are present

#### Horizon Detection → QFT → Detection

## Recommendations

1. **Performance Optimization**: For production use with very large grids (>100,000 points), consider implementing parallel processing for adaptive sigma calculations.

2. **Extended Testing**: Implement additional tests with real WarpX backend when available to validate the full PIC integration.

3. **Documentation**: Add more detailed documentation on the physical assumptions and limitations of each module.

4. **Validation**: Compare results with analytical solutions where available to further validate the numerical methods.
