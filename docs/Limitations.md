Limitations
-----------

- Fluid/superposition surrogates: No PIC/fluid full-physics validation yet.
- Coarse-graining choice: Envelope/skin-depth scale is assumed; real coupling may differ.
- κ surrogate: Mapping from intensity gradients to κ uses simple ponderomotive scaling and τ; results are trend-level, not absolute.
- Sound speed: Often treated as uniform; real c_s(x) profiles can shift horizon positions.
