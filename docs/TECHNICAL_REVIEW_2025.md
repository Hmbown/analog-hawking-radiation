**Version Reviewed:** v0.3.0
**Review Date:** October 27, 2025
**Reviewer Context:** Technical implementation, scientific significance, and academic potential assessment

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Overall Novelty Rating: **7.5/10**

**Most Significant Contribution:**
This work provides the **first systematic computational mapping of physics breakdown limits** (κ_max ≈ 3.8×10¹² Hz) for laser-plasma analog horizons, revealing an unexpected inverse scaling relationship (κ ∝ a₀⁻⁰·¹⁹³) that challenges naive assumptions about maximizing surface gravity through increased laser intensity. The integration of fluid models, PIC workflows, and Bayesian parameter inference into a single reproducible framework fills a critical gap between theoretical analog gravity predictions and experimental feasibility assessment.

### Biggest Strengths

**Technical:**
1. **Backend abstraction architecture** - Clean separation between physics models (Fluid/WarpX) enables validation across computational approaches
2. **GPU acceleration with graceful degradation** - Production-ready CuPy integration with automatic CPU fallback
3. **Comprehensive validation framework** - Conservation law checking, physical bounds enforcement, numerical stability detection
4. **Publication-quality documentation** - 18 well-structured markdown files covering theory, methods, experiments, and limitations

**Scientific:**
1. **Gradient catastrophe analysis** - Novel systematic exploration of relativistic breakdown boundaries
2. **Multi-method κ definitions** - Three surface gravity calculation methods (legacy, acoustic, acoustic-exact) with uncertainty quantification
3. **Graybody transmission solver** - Physics-motivated acoustic-WKB implementation using tortoise coordinates
4. **Universality collapse testing** - Empirical validation of κ-normalized spectral scaling across configurations

### Key Limitations

1. **1D approximation** - All physics models restrict to 1D profiles; multi-dimensional effects (transverse gradients, 3D scattering) not captured
2. **Experimental validation gap** - No comparison with actual experimental data; WarpX integration uses mock configurations
3. **Hybrid mirror coupling** - Plasma mirror enhancement factors are speculative and lack kinetic validation
4. **Detection time estimates** - Radio SNR forecasts use simplified radiometer equation without realistic noise sources or experimental systematics

## 1. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT

### 1.1 Code Quality & Architecture

**Overall Assessment: Excellent (8.5/10)**

**Architecture Strengths:**
- **Clean abstraction layers:** The `PlasmaBackend` abstract base class (`src/analog_hawking/physics_engine/plasma_models/backend.py`) enables hot-swapping between `FluidBackend` and `WarpXBackend` implementations, facilitating cross-validation between analytical and first-principles kinetic models.

- **Dataclass-driven data flow:** Type-safe pipeline from `PlasmaState` → `HorizonResult` → `GraybodyResult` → `FullPipelineSummary` ensures well-defined interfaces and serializable outputs.

- **Array backend dispatch:** The `utils/array_module.py` module provides transparent NumPy/CuPy switching with fallback detection, enabling 10-100× GPU speedups without code duplication.

**Code Organization:**
```
Codebase Statistics:
- Source LOC: ~6,815 lines (src/)
- Test LOC: ~1,263 lines (tests/)
- Test modules: 20 files
- Scripts: 70+ workflow entry points
- Documentation: 18 markdown files
```

**Code Quality Metrics:**
- **Modularity:** High - physics engines, detection, inference, pipelines cleanly separated
- **Readability:** Good - docstrings present, variable names descriptive, type hints used
- **Error handling:** Adequate - graceful fallbacks, but some edge cases rely on assertions rather than exceptions
- **Performance:** GPU-optimized critical paths, but some parameter sweeps remain single-threaded

### 1.2 Core Algorithm Analysis

#### Horizon Detection (`horizon.py:87-200`)
**Implementation:** Standard root-finding via sign-change detection on f(x) = |v| - c_s, refined with bisection.

**Novelty: LOW** - This is a textbook approach; similar methods appear in BEC analog experiments (Steinhauer 2016). The multi-stencil uncertainty estimation (±1,2,3 grid points) is practical but numerically rather than physically motivated.

**Quality: GOOD** - Robust handling of edge cases (exact equalities, boundary effects), but uncertainty estimates do not propagate upstream model errors.

#### Surface Gravity Calculation (`horizon.py:140-180`)
**Implementation:** Three κ definitions:
1. `acoustic`: κ ≈ |∂ₓ(c_s - |v|)| at horizon
2. `acoustic_exact`: κ = |∂ₓ(c_s² - v²)|/(2c_H) interpolated at root
3. `legacy`: κ = 0.5·|∂ₓ(|v| - c_s)| (backward compatible)

**Novelty: MODERATE** - The `acoustic_exact` form appears in analog gravity literature but the multi-method comparison with uncertainty bands is valuable for cross-validation.

**Literature comparison:** The exact form κ = |∂ₓ(c_s² - v²)|/(2c_H) aligns with the surface gravity definition from Unruh (1981) and Barceló et al. (2005) in the acoustic geometry context. The implementation is standard.

#### Graybody Transmission Solver (`graybody_1d.py:47-200`)
**Implementation:** Three modes:
1. **Dimensionless:** T(ω) = (ω/ω_c)² / (1 + (ω/ω_c)²) with ω_c = ακ (Page-like suppression)
2. **Acoustic-WKB:** Constructs tortoise coordinate x* via dx* = dx/|c - |v||, builds effective potential V(x*) ~ (ακ)² S(x*), computes WKB tunnel transmission
3. **WKB-legacy:** Experimental velocity-based potential (unit-mismatch caveats noted)

**Novelty: MODERATE to HIGH**
- The acoustic-WKB mode with tortoise coordinate construction for analog systems is more sophisticated than simple low-frequency suppression factors used in early BEC experiments
- GPU-accelerated implementation (CuPy) is computationally novel for this domain
- The three-mode comparison enables sensitivity analysis

**Literature comparison:** Graybody factors for BEC analogs are discussed in Macher & Parentani (2009) and Coutant & Parentani (2014), who use WKB and scattering approaches. This implementation captures the same physics but adds GPU acceleration and multi-method validation.

**Quality: GOOD** - Physically motivated, numerically stable, but remains 1D and does not account for dissipation or multi-dimensional scattering (acknowledged in limitations).

#### PIC Integration (`pic_adapter.py`, `warpx_backend.py`)
**Implementation:**
- openPMD HDF5 ingestion from WarpX/OSIRIS diagnostics
- Adaptive sigma smoothing to avoid over-filtering near horizons
- Multi-dimensional → 1D slice extraction

**Novelty: HIGH**
This appears to be the **first publicly available integration of full PIC outputs (WarpX) into analog Hawking horizon detection workflows**. Literature search found:
- AnaBHEL collaboration (Chen et al. 2022) mentions PIC simulations but no open-source pipeline
- No evidence of WarpX being used for analog Hawking studies before this work

**Quality: GOOD with caveats**
- Clean openPMD parsing using `openpmd_api`
- Adaptive smoothing via plasma length scales (skin depth, Debye length)
- **Gap:** Mock mode only; no validation against actual WarpX runs with real laser-plasma physics

### 1.3 Novelty of Implementation

**Novel Implementations:**
1. ✓ **Gradient catastrophe systematic sweep** - No prior systematic parameter space mapping found in literature
2. ✓ **WarpX → analog horizon pipeline** - First open-source integration
3. ✓ **GPU-accelerated graybody solver** - CuPy implementation novel to field
4. ✓ **Bayesian κ inference from PSDs** - Parameter recovery approach new to analog gravity
5. ✓ **Multi-backend orchestration engine** - Phase-based experiment automation

**Standard Techniques Applied:**
1. Horizon root finding - Standard approach from BEC experiments
2. Radiometer SNR equation - Direct application from radio astronomy
3. Planck spectrum calculation - Textbook quantum field theory
4. Conservation law validation - Standard plasma physics checks

**Novel Combinations:**
The **end-to-end workflow** (PIC → horizons → QFT → detection feasibility → Bayesian inference) represents a novel **systems integration** even if individual components use established methods.

## 2. SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE ANALYSIS

### 2.1 Gradient Catastrophe Findings

**Claimed Discovery:** Maximum achievable surface gravity κ_max ≈ 3.8×10¹² Hz before relativistic breakdown, with scaling κ ∝ a₀⁻⁰·¹⁹³.

**Analysis:**

**Physics Validity:** ✓ **SOUND**
The breakdown mechanisms monitored are physically motivated:
- Relativistic breakdown (v > 0.5c): Fundamental limit when acoustic approximation fails
- Ionization breakdown: Density going negative or exceeding solid density
- Gradient catastrophe: ∂ₓv → ∞ (wave breaking)
- Numerical instability: NaN/Inf detection

**Novelty Assessment: HIGH**

**Literature comparison:**
- AnaBHEL paper (Chen et al. 2022) mentions "potential backgrounds" from simulations but provides no systematic κ_max analysis
- BEC experiments (Steinhauer 2016) report κ ~ 10⁹ Hz but are limited by condensate physics, not laser-plasma constraints
- No published work found systematically mapping the relativistic breakdown boundary for laser-plasma analog horizons

**This appears to be genuinely new.** The finding that κ **decreases** with increasing laser amplitude (inverse scaling) contradicts naive intuition and represents a non-trivial physics insight.

**Quantitative Validation:**

The key claims from `docs/GradientCatastropheAnalysis.md`:
1. **κ_max = 3.79×10¹² Hz** → Corresponds to T_H ~ 4.6K via T_H = ħκ/(2πk_B)
2. **Optimal a₀ ≈ 1.6** → Normalized amplitude, corresponds to I ~ 5.7×10⁵⁰ W/m² for 800nm laser
3. **Scaling κ ∝ a₀⁻⁰·¹⁹³** → Power-law fit from 500 samples

**Concern:** The required intensity **I ~ 5.7×10⁵⁰ W/m²** vastly exceeds current experimental capabilities:
- State-of-art facilities (Apollon, ELI): ~10²³ W/cm² = 10²⁷ W/m²
- This work requires **10²³× higher intensity**

**Interpretation:** The "optimal" configuration is **theoretically interesting but experimentally inaccessible**. The authors acknowledge this indirectly (Limitations.md mentions "realistic" as distinct from "achievable").

### 2.2 Scaling Relationships

**Finding:** κ ∝ a₀⁻⁰·¹⁹³ (inverse scaling)

**Physics Explanation from code inspection:**
From `sweep_gradient_catastrophe.py`, the velocity profile construction:
```python
v_scale = cs_thermal * 1.5 * a₀ * gradient_factor
velocity = v_scale * tanh((x - x_transition) / sigma)
```

Higher a₀ → higher velocities → **exceeds relativistic limit (v > 0.5c) sooner** → breakdown before high κ achieved.

**This makes physical sense** and represents a real constraint, but is it a fundamental discovery or a consequence of the specific profile parameterization?

**Verdict:** The inverse scaling is **physically motivated but model-dependent**. Different profile constructions (e.g., self-consistent PIC simulations with realistic laser-plasma dynamics) might yield different scalings. The finding is valuable for **design space guidance** but should not be claimed as a universal law without PIC validation.

### 2.3 Physics Validation Framework Effectiveness

**Implementation:** `validation_protocols.py` checks:
- Energy conservation (electromagnetic + kinetic)
- Momentum conservation (including ponderomotive force)
- Physical bounds (v < 0.99c, T > 0, ρ > 0)
- Numerical stability (NaN/Inf detection)
- Theoretical consistency (T_H = ħκ/(2πk_B))

**Effectiveness: MODERATE to GOOD**

**Strengths:**
- Catches obvious pathologies (NaN, unphysical densities)
- Enforces well-known relations (Hawking temperature formula)

**Limitations:**
- Energy/momentum conservation checking is **descriptive, not prescriptive** - violations are detected but not corrected
- Thresholds (v < 0.99c, etc.) are somewhat arbitrary
- No validation against **analytical solutions** (e.g., known exact solutions for simple horizon configurations)

**Comparison to field standards:**
Plasma physics codes typically use:
- Poynting theorem conservation (this code does not explicitly check)
- Particle number conservation (mentioned but not clearly implemented)
- Comparison to known analytical limits (e.g., linear wave dispersion)

**Verdict:** The validation framework is **better than most academic codes** but below standards for production plasma simulation codes (e.g., WarpX's own validation suite).

### 2.4 Universality Spectrum Collapse

**Claim:** κ-normalized spectra from different configurations collapse onto a universal curve.

**Analysis:**

**Physics expectation:** If the Hawking spectrum truly depends only on κ (as quantum field theory on curved spacetime predicts), then P(ω)/f(κ) vs. ω/κ should collapse for all systems with the same effective metric.

**Implementation:** `sweep_multi_physics_params.py` tests this empirically by:
1. Generating multiple configurations (varying plasma density, laser intensity, gradients)
2. Computing spectra for each
3. Normalizing by κ and overlaying

**Finding (from release notes):** "κ-normalized spectra from analytic and PIC-derived profiles align on a common curve"

**Novelty: MODERATE**

**Literature context:**
- BEC experiments (Steinhauer 2016, Muñoz de Nova et al. 2019) **already demonstrated universality** via correlation measurements
- Theoretical prediction from Unruh (1981), Hawking (1975) - not new physics

**This work's contribution:**
- **Computational validation** of universality for laser-plasma systems
- **Cross-backend validation** (Fluid vs WarpX) - this is valuable for code verification

**Verdict:** Not a novel physics discovery, but useful **computational verification** and **demonstration that the code implementation is self-consistent**.

## 3. RESEARCH QUALITY EVALUATION

### 3.1 Methodology Rigor

**Parameter Space Sampling:**
- Gradient catastrophe sweep: 500 samples (Latin hypercube or random not specified)
- 3-parameter space: a₀ ∈ [1, 100], nₑ ∈ [10¹⁸, 10²²], gradient_factor ∈ [1, 1000]

**Concern:** Sampling strategy not described in gradient catastrophe documentation. Random vs. structured sampling (LHS, Sobol, etc.) affects coverage and convergence.

**Uncertainty Quantification:**
- Multi-stencil (±1,2,3 grid points) provides **numerical uncertainty**
- **No physical uncertainty propagation** from input parameters (laser intensity fluctuations, density uncertainties, etc.)

**Verdict: ADEQUATE for numerical convergence, INSUFFICIENT for experimental predictive power**

### 3.2 Reproducibility & Documentation

**Documentation Quality: EXCELLENT (9/10)**

**Strengths:**
- 18 comprehensive markdown files covering:
  - Theory (Overview.md, Methods.md)
  - Workflows (Experiments.md, AdvancedScenarios.md)
  - Findings (GradientCatastropheAnalysis.md)
  - Limitations (Limitations.md - **rare honesty in academic code**)
  - References (REFERENCES.md with bibliography)

- **Experiment playbooks** with explicit commands, expected runtimes, output locations
- **Multiple learning paths** for different user types (experimental physicists, simulation specialists, theorists, "vibe coders")

**Weaknesses:**
- No **Jupyter notebooks** or interactive tutorials
- **Sample outputs** mentioned but minimal actual data included in repo
- **Reproducibility:** No Docker container or conda environment specification for exact dependency reproduction

**Comparison to field standards:**
Better than 90% of academic physics codes but below standards of major community codes (e.g., WarpX has Docker images, full CI/CD, containerized benchmarks).

### 3.3 Testing Coverage

**Test Statistics:**
- **42 tests** across 20 test modules
- **Test-to-source ratio:** ~1,263 / 6,815 = **0.185** (industry standard ~1.0, academic typical ~0.1-0.3)

**Coverage Areas:**
- ✓ Unit tests: Physics formulas (graybody, horizon κ, radiometer equation)
- ✓ Integration tests: Full pipeline (FluidBackend → horizon → QFT → SNR)
- ✓ Workflow tests: CLI argument parsing, file I/O
- ✗ Performance tests: No explicit runtime benchmarks
- ✗ Regression tests: No baseline comparison dataset

**Key Test: `integration_test.py`**

Validates:
1. `FluidBackend` produces valid `PlasmaState`
2. `find_horizons_with_uncertainty` works with plasma state
3. QFT spectrum calculation succeeds
4. Detection SNR pipeline produces reasonable values

**Missing:**
- **No comparison to analytical solutions** (e.g., known exact graybody factors for specific potentials)
- **No PIC validation test** - WarpX backend only tested in mock mode
- **No physics regression test** - no "golden" reference dataset to detect algorithmic changes

**Verdict: GOOD for code correctness, INSUFFICIENT for physics validation**

## 4. LITERATURE POSITIONING & ACADEMIC POTENTIAL

### 4.1 Literature Comparison

**Precedent Studies:**

1. **BEC Analogs (Experimental)**
   - Steinhauer (2016): "Observation of quantum Hawking radiation and its entanglement in an analogue black hole"
     - κ ~ 10⁹ Hz achieved in rubidium BECs at nanokelvin temperatures
     - Correlation measurements demonstrated Hawking pair production
   - **Comparison:** This work targets **10³× higher κ** for laser-plasma but lacks experimental validation

2. **AnaBHEL Collaboration (Theoretical/Planned)**
   - Chen et al. (2022): "AnaBHEL (Analog Black Hole Evaporation via Lasers) Experiment: Concept, Design, and Status"
     - Proposes accelerating plasma mirror via ultra-intense laser through density down-ramp
     - Mentions PIC simulations but no open code
   - **Comparison:** This work provides the **computational infrastructure** AnaBHEL lacks publicly, but remains in design phase like AnaBHEL

3. **Graybody Factors (Theoretical)**
   - Macher & Parentani (2009): "Black-hole radiation in Bose-Einstein condensates"
   - Coutant & Parentani (2014): "Black hole radiation with short distance dispersion"
   - **Comparison:** This work implements similar WKB methods but for laser-plasma systems and adds GPU acceleration

4. **PIC + Analog Gravity (Computational - SPARSE)**
   - Limited literature found on PIC simulations for analog Hawking radiation
   - Analogue Hawking temperature paper (2021, arXiv:2102.02556) mentions PIC but no systematic study
   - **This work appears to be among the first to integrate WarpX/openPMD into analog horizon workflows**

### 4.2 What This Work Adds to Literature

**Novel Contributions:**
1. ✓ **First systematic gradient catastrophe mapping for laser-plasma analogs**
2. ✓ **First open-source PIC integration pipeline** (WarpX → horizons)
3. ✓ **GPU-accelerated workflow** for parameter space exploration
4. ✓ **End-to-end design tool** linking experimental parameters to detection forecasts

**Incremental Contributions:**
1. Implementation of known graybody methods for new platform (laser-plasma)
2. Computational verification of universality (already demonstrated experimentally in BECs)
3. Multi-backend validation framework (useful for code development, less so for physics discovery)

### 4.3 Gaps Filled

**Critical Gap:** Between theoretical analog gravity predictions and experimental design constraints.

AnaBHEL and similar proposals lack:
- Systematic parameter space exploration
- Physics breakdown detection
- Detection feasibility assessment with realistic integration times

**This work fills these gaps** but remains in the **computational/design phase** without experimental validation.

### 4.4 Claims Assessment

**Substantiated Claims:**
- ✓ "First systematic gradient catastrophe analysis" - No prior published work found
- ✓ "WarpX integration" - Code exists, though only mock-tested
- ✓ "GPU acceleration" - CuPy integration verified, benchmarks reported
- ✓ "Comprehensive validation framework" - Implementation exists

**Overstated Claims:**
- ⚠ "Maximum κ ≈ 3.8×10¹² Hz" - True for the **model used**, but:
  - Parameterization-dependent
  - Requires unattainable laser intensities (10⁵⁰ W/m²)
  - Not validated with self-consistent PIC runs

- ⚠ "Universality spectrum collapse" - Demonstrated **computationally** but already known from BEC experiments

- ⚠ "Hybrid plasma mirror coupling" - Explicitly labeled "speculative" in limitations, good, but still appears in results

**Missing Caveats:**
- The **experimental inaccessibility** of optimal parameters should be more prominent
- The **model-dependence** of gradient catastrophe findings should be emphasized
- The **lack of PIC validation** should be stated as a critical next step in abstracts

## 6. RED FLAGS & OVERSTATED CLAIMS

### 6.1 Major Red Flags

⚠️ **1. Experimental Inaccessibility Not Emphasized**

**Finding:** Optimal κ_max requires I ~ 5.7×10⁵⁰ W/m²

**Current state-of-art:** Apollon laser ~ 10²⁷ W/m²

**Gap:** **10²³× higher intensity required**

**Location of concern:** `GradientCatastropheAnalysis.md` mentions "challenging but potentially achievable with next-generation laser systems" (line 127) - this is **misleading**. Current lasers would need **quintillion-fold improvement**, not incremental progress.

**Recommendation:** Add explicit caveat: "The optimal parameters identified here (I ~ 10⁵⁰ W/m²) exceed current and foreseeable laser capabilities by ~23 orders of magnitude. These findings represent **theoretical limits**, not experimental targets."

⚠️ **2. Gradient Catastrophe "Discovery" May Be Model Artifact**

**Concern:** The inverse scaling κ ∝ a₀⁻⁰·¹⁹³ derives from the specific profile parameterization:
```python
v_scale = cs_thermal * 1.5 * a₀ * gradient_factor
```

This is a **constructed profile**, not self-consistent plasma physics.

**Missing:** Validation that real laser-plasma systems (from PIC) exhibit this behavior.

**Recommendation:** Retitle finding as "Gradient catastrophe in parameterized profiles" and add PIC validation as critical next step.

⚠️ **3. Hybrid Plasma Mirror Coupling Lacks Kinetic Validation**

**Code:** `horizon_hybrid.py`, `plasma_mirror.py` implement **speculative** coupling between fluid horizons and plasma mirror dynamics.

**Good:** `Limitations.md` acknowledges "speculative" nature
**Bad:** Results still show hybrid enhancement factors without clear WARNING labels

**Recommendation:** Add "SPECULATIVE - NOT VALIDATED" watermark to all hybrid figures, move to appendix in publications.

### 6.2 Minor Red Flags

⚠️ **Test coverage gaps:**
- No analytical solution comparisons
- No physics regression tests
- WarpX backend only mock-tested

⚠️ **Documentation claims:**
- README mentions "42 tests passing" but actual count is 20 test files (not 42 test functions explicitly counted)
- Minor: Test count may refer to test functions vs test files - ambiguous

⚠️ **Reproducibility:**
- No exact environment specification (Docker, conda env export)
- GPU benchmarks not reproducible without specific hardware documentation

### 6.3 Validation Gaps Needing Immediate Address

**Critical:**
1. **PIC validation:** Run real WarpX simulations, compare to fluid predictions
2. **Analytical benchmarks:** Add at least 3 test cases with known exact solutions
3. **Experimental parameter assessment:** Clear table of achievable vs. required values

**Important:**
4. **Physical uncertainty propagation:** Monte Carlo over input parameter ranges
5. **Cross-code validation:** Compare to other analog gravity codes (if available)
6. **Peer review by analog gravity experts:** External physics review before publication

## 8. FINAL VERDICT

### Most Important Takeaway

**This is excellent computational infrastructure work with one genuinely novel finding (gradient catastrophe mapping) but lacks the experimental validation needed for top-tier physics journals.**

**As a software tool:** ★★★★★ (5/5) - Publication-ready for JOSS/CPC immediately
**As a physics discovery:** ★★★☆☆ (3/5) - Interesting but needs experimental confirmation
**As experimental design tool:** ★★★★☆ (4/5) - Useful for community once validated

### Recommended Framing

**Avoid:** "We have discovered the maximum surface gravity for analog black holes"
**Prefer:** "We present a systematic computational framework for exploring parameter space and identifying physics breakdown regimes in laser-plasma analog horizons"

**Avoid:** "Detection is feasible in nanosecond timescales"
**Prefer:** "For theoretically optimal (but experimentally inaccessible) parameters, detection timescales could approach microseconds; achievable parameters require longer integration"

**Avoid:** "Novel universality spectrum collapse"
**Prefer:** "Computational validation of universality, consistent with prior BEC experiments"

### Unique Strengths to Emphasize

1. **First open-source end-to-end pipeline** from PIC → horizons → detection forecast
2. **Systematic gradient catastrophe exploration** revealing inverse intensity scaling
3. **GPU-accelerated production workflows** enabling parameter space mapping
4. **Exceptional documentation and reproducibility** for academic code
5. **Honest acknowledgment of limitations** (rare in academic publishing)

### This Work's Place in the Field

**Analogy:** This is to analog Hawking radiation what **GRMHD codes** (HARM, Athena++) are to black hole accretion - not the discovery of new physics, but the **computational infrastructure enabling systematic exploration** of known physics in new regimes.

**Impact:** Over 5-10 years, this could become the **reference implementation** for laser-plasma analog gravity studies, similar to how WarpX is now the standard for laser-plasma acceleration. That's a **significant contribution** even without headline physics discoveries.

### Bottom Line

- ✅ **Publish the software** (JOSS - immediate)
- ✅ **Publish the methodology** (CPC - after PIC validation)
- ⏳ **Publish the physics** (PRD - after experimental validation)
- 🎯 **Build the community** (workshops, tutorials, partnerships)

This is **strong work** that makes a **real contribution** to an emerging field. With focused effort on validation and careful framing of claims, it has **clear publication pathway** and **genuine long-term impact potential**.
