# Project Identity: The Subtle Art of Boundary Physics

## Tagline Options

**Primary**: "Laboratory Black Hole Detection, Quantified"

**Alternatives**:
- "Where Plasma Flow Becomes Spacetime Geometry"
- "Engineering the Universe's Most Subtle Boundary"
- "Detection Frameworks for Analog Gravity Research"

## Visual Identity Suggestions

**Color Palette** (Professional, Subtle):
- Deep Blue: `#1E3A8A` (trust, rigor)
- Graphite: `#374151` (precision, professionalism)  
- Signal Red: `#DC2626` (detection thresholds, critical values)
- Clean White: `#FFFFFF` (clarity, transparency)

**Typography**: Clean, scientific sans-serif (Inter, Source Sans Pro)

**Iconography**: Minimalist representations of:
- Sonic horizon boundary conditions
- Surface gravity (κ) mappings
- Detection probability curves
- Uncertainty propagation diagrams

## Voice & Tone

**Scientific but Accessible**: "We measured κ = 5.94×10¹² Hz with 95% confidence intervals [5.2, 6.7]×10¹² Hz"

**Confident but Honest**: "These results are model-dependent and dataset-specific, not universal constants"

**Professional but Engaging**: Every section answers "Why should an experimentalist care about this calculation?"

## Content Strategy

Lead with methodology, follow with results, conclude with implications. Every claim earns its place through:
1. Mathematical derivation
2. Numerical validation  
3. Experimental relevance
4. Uncertainty quantification

The intrigue emerges from watching complex physics resolve into actionable experimental guidance.
