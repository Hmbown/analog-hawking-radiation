# Project Ethos: Between Certainty and Discovery

## Our Approach

**Validated Physics Only**: We ship no speculation without warning labels. Every "experimental" feature is clearly marked, every assumption documented, every limitation front-and-center.

**Professional Tools for Professional Questions**: This framework serves experimentalists who need answers, not animations. Every plot must justify its ink; every parameter must earn its place.

**Transparency as Methodology**: Our validation suite isn't just code—it's a statement of scientific integrity. When we say "κ = 5.94×10¹² Hz," we also say "here's exactly how uncertain we are, and why."

## The Intrigue of Precision

The mystique lies not in cosmic wonder but in methodological elegance: watching uncertainty propagate through a calculation until it crystallizes into a detection probability. The moment when chaos resolves into a measurable signal—that's our theater.

## Academic Rigor, Accessible Presentation

We translate between communities:
- **For experimentalists**: "Here's what your equipment needs to resolve"
- **For theorists**: "Here are the assumptions that must hold"
- **For reviewers**: "Here's every step we took, documented and reproducible"

No hand-waving. No cosmic poetry. Just physics, rendered so clearly that its beauty becomes obvious.
