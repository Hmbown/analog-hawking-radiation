Subject: Open-source analog Hawking toolkit (fluid→graybody→radio) – early results & request for feedback

Dear Prof. [LAST_NAME],

I'm an independent/citizen physicist building an open-source pipeline that connects fluid profiles → horizon/κ diagnostics → graybody transmission → radio-band detectability. It also ingests openPMD/PIC outputs (e.g., WarpX) to test "universality" via κ-normalized spectra.

In a single-GPU setup (RTX 3080), I can reproduce baseline horizons, run universality-collapse sweeps, and map pre-breakdown κ limits. I'd love your candid feedback on (a) methodological gaps, (b) plausibility of the assumptions, and (c) which diagnostics would be most convincing to your community.

Links and 1–2 representative figures are below; a 1‑page summary is attached.
If you see value, I'd be grateful for 15 minutes of guidance on what to test next.
