Subject: Re: Open-source analog Hawking toolkit – follow-up & additional results

Dear Prof. [LAST_NAME],

I hope this finds you well. I'm following up on my email from [DATE] regarding our open-source analog Hawking radiation analysis pipeline.

Since my last message, I've:
- [COMPLETED ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS: e.g., "applied the pipeline to openPMD example datasets"]
- [GENERATED NEW RESULTS: e.g., "run gradient-catastrophe breakdown analysis"]
- [ADDRESSED FEEDBACK: e.g., "implemented Bayesian κ-inference with error quantification"]

New results that might interest you:
[SPECIFIC RESULT 1 - 1 sentence]
[SPECIFIC RESULT 2 - 1 sentence]
[ATTACH: updated_figure.png]

I'm still very interested in your perspective on:
- [SPECIFIC QUESTION 1]
- [SPECIFIC QUESTION 2]

If now isn't a good time, I completely understand. Would you prefer if I follow up in [SUGGEST TIMEFRAME: 3 months/specific month]?

Thank you again for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
[YOUR_NAME]

FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY:

When to Send Follow-Up:
- No response after 2 weeks (10 business days)
- Only send ONE follow-up unless they specifically request updates
- Space follow-up at least 1 month after initial email
- If they respond but defer, respect their timing

When NOT to Send Follow-Up:
- If they explicitly said "not interested"
- If they referred you to someone else (thank them and contact that person)
- If it's been more than 6 months (start fresh)

Follow-Up Variations:

Option A: "Additional Results"
- Send when you have genuinely new/analyzed results
- Keep it short (<100 words)
- Focus on 1-2 new insights

Option B: "Checking In"
- Simple check-in if no specific news
- Ask if now is better time
- Very brief (<75 words)

Option C: "Quick Question"
- If you have one specific question
- Don't expect long response
- Make question very focused

SAMPLE FOLLOW-UP EMAILS:

Follow-Up A - With New Results:
---
Subject: Re: Analogue Hawking toolkit – gradient breakdown analysis complete

Dear Prof. [LAST_NAME],

Quick follow-up on my email from [DATE]. I've now completed the gradient-catastrophe breakdown analysis we discussed.

Key finding: κ_max ≈ [VALUE] before relativistic breakdown, consistent with [THEIR WORK/EXPECTATIONS].

[ATTACH: breakdown_analysis.png]

Still very interested in your thoughts on whether this parameter regime is relevant for [THEIR RESEARCH AREA].

Best,

Follow-Up B - Simple Check-In:
---
Subject: Following up: Analogue Hawking analysis

Dear Prof. [LAST_NAME],

Following up on my email from [DATE] about our analogue Hawking radiation analysis pipeline. I know you're very busy.

If now isn't a good time for feedback, would you prefer I follow up in [MONTH] instead?

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
[NAME]

Follow-Up C - After Referral:
---
Subject: Thank you for the referral

Dear Prof. [LAST_NAME],

Thank you for referring me to Dr. [NAME] regarding [TOPIC]. I've reached out with your recommendation and will update you if anything develops.

In case you're interested in seeing where this goes, I'll be happy to share any relevant results.

Best,
[NAME]

MANAGING MULTIPLE FOLLOW-UPS:

Max 2 total touches (initial + 1 follow-up)

After that:
- If interested but busy: "Let me know when better time"
- If no response: Archive and move on
- If referred to colleague: Thank them, contact colleague
- If positive but no follow-through: Thank them, stay in touch with updates

Always maintain professionalism and respect their time. A polite "no thanks" is a complete answer.
