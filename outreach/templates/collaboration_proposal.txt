Subject: Collaboration opportunity: Analogue Hawking analysis of [THEIR_DATA/SYSTEM]

Dear Prof. [LAST_NAME],

Thank you for your positive response to my outreach regarding the analogue Hawking radiation analysis pipeline.

I'd like to propose a concrete collaboration that would benefit both of us:

### What I Can Provide

1. **Pipeline access and expertise**
   - Complete open-source codebase
   - GPU-accelerated analysis (RTX 3080)
   - κ-inference with Bayesian uncertainty quantification
   - Graybody transmission calculations
   - Radio-band detectability forecasts

2. **Analysis services**
   - Apply pipeline to your [data/profiles/simulations]
   - Generate publication-quality figures
   - Produce JSON summaries for your records
   - Compare results with your independent analyses

3. **Documentation**
   - Detailed methodology documentation
   - Reproducible analysis workflows
   - Method validation against known benchmarks

### What I'm Hoping For

1. **Validation and feedback**
   - Apply to your experimental/theoretical data
   - Compare with your published analyses
   - Identify improvements or corrections needed

2. **Collaboration opportunities**
   - Co-author on any resulting publications
   - Credits for pipeline development
   - Recognition for open-source contribution

3. **Scientific guidance**
   - Which parameters matter most for your system?
   - What are the key assumptions to validate?
   - How should we frame results for your community?

### Proposed Next Steps

1. **Initial consultation** (30 minutes, video call)
   - Discuss your specific research goals
   - Identify relevant data/profiles
   - Define success metrics

2. **Pilot analysis** (1-2 weeks)
   - Apply pipeline to a small dataset
   - Generate preliminary results
   - Validate methodology

3. **Full analysis** (2-4 weeks, depending on data size)
   - Complete analysis
   - Generate publication figures
   - Prepare draft text

4. **Publication preparation** (as needed)
   - Co-author manuscript preparation
   - Submit to appropriate journal
   - Present at conference

### Data and Information Needed

To get started, could you provide:

- [Specific to their system: e.g., "fluid velocity profiles v(x)"]
- [e.g., "sound speed profiles c_s(x)"]
- [e.g., "experimental PSD data"]
- [e.g., "PIC simulation outputs (openPMD format)"]
- Key parameters: [e.g., "density, temperature, flow speed"]
- Known quantities: [e.g., "horizon position, κ estimates"]

I'm happy to work with whatever format you have and can provide guidance on data preparation if needed.

### Timeline and Expectations

I can commit to:
- Responding to emails within 24-48 hours
- Providing preliminary results within 2 weeks of receiving data
- Maintaining open communication throughout
- Respecting any publication embargoes or restrictions

The analysis work is flexible and can adapt to your schedule. No pressure on timelines - quality results are more important than speed.

### Intellectual Property

- Analysis pipeline remains open-source (MIT license)
- You retain full rights to your data
- Collaboration contributions will be properly credited
- Any publications will include appropriate acknowledgments

### References

I've attached:
1. Pipeline summary (1-page PDF)
2. Repository link: https://github.com/Hmbown/analog-hawking-radiation
3. Example results from recent runs

Please let me know if this sounds interesting and what questions you have.

Would you be available for a brief call next week to discuss further?

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
[YOUR_NAME]
[YOUR_EMAIL]

## Collaboration Scenario Variations

### Scenario 1: They Have Data

**Subject**: Re: Your data analysis request

**Approach**:
- Lead with how you can analyze their specific data
- Show you understand their experimental/theoretical setup
- Offer specific deliverables
- Ask for data format and key parameters

**Customization points**:
- Mention specific technique/instrument they use
- Reference their recent papers
- Ask about their current analysis methods

### Scenario 2: They Want to Use the Code

**Subject**: Re: Using the open-source pipeline

**Approach**:
- Provide installation and usage documentation
- Offer to help with setup
- Suggest test cases with known results
- Propose collaboration for validation

**Customization points**:
- Their programming experience level
- Hardware availability (GPU access)
- Expected use case (research/teaching)

### Scenario 3: They Refer a Colleague

**Subject**: Re: [Colleague] suggested I contact you

**Approach**:
- Acknowledge the referral
- Provide brief context
- Ask for 15 minutes of their time
- Mention the referral source

**Customization points**:
- Reference what [Colleague] said
- Connect their work to referred topic
- Respect their time constraints

### Scenario 4: Student/Postdoc Contact

**Subject**: Re: Analogue Hawking pipeline (Prof. [NAME] suggested I reach out)

**Approach**:
- Same as above but more collaborative tone
- Offer mentoring opportunities
- Suggest student project possibilities
- Include Prof. [Name] in CC

**Customization points**:
- Student's specific research area
- Timeline for graduation/position
- Course credit or acknowledgment possibilities

## Negotiation Tips

### Be Flexible
- Adapt to their timeline and needs
- Don't insist on co-authorship if they prefer acknowledgment only
- Respect their constraints and preferences

### Provide Value First
- Do good work before asking for anything
- Deliver results that exceed expectations
- Be responsive and professional

### Document Everything
- Write down any agreements
- Confirm understanding via email
- Keep records of contributions

### Be Professional
- Respect their time and priorities
- Don't be pushy or demanding
- Accept "no" gracefully

### Handle Rejection Well
- Thank them for considering
- Ask if they'd recommend someone else
- Keep door open for future

## When to Walk Away

- They want you to do all work with no credit
- They claim ownership of your code
- They want exclusive rights to analysis
- Timeline is unreasonable or unclear
- Communication becomes unprofessional

Remember: There are many researchers interested in analogue gravity. If one collaboration doesn't work out, there are others who will be more reasonable.
