**PDF Creation Command:**
```bash
# If you have matplotlib and results:
python - <<'PY'
# Create 1-page summary PDF using matplotlib
# See example code below
PY
```

**Example PDF Generation Code:**
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import json
from matplotlib.backends.backend_pdf import PdfPages

# Load results
with open('results/full_pipeline_summary.json') as f:
    results = json.load(f)

# Create PDF
with PdfPages('outreach/results_pack.pdf') as pdf:
    fig, ((ax1, ax2), (ax3, ax4)) = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(11, 8.5))
    # ... plot generation ...
    pdf.savefig(fig, bbox_inches='tight')
    plt.close()
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Don't send without running pipelines first
❌ Don't use generic template without customization
❌ Don't send low-resolution or unlabeled figures
❌ Don't email without verifying contact info
❌ Don't send follow-up if they explicitly declined
❌ Don't attach too many files (>3 attachments)
❌ Don't use overly technical jargon
❌ Don't claim more than results support

## Success Metrics

Track these metrics in `notes/outreach_log.csv`:
- Total contacted
- Response rate (% who responded)
- Positive response rate (% who expressed interest)
- Meeting rate (% who agreed to discuss)
- Follow-up rate (% who responded after 2 weeks)

Target goals:
- Response rate: >20%
- Positive rate: >10%
- Meeting rate: >5%
