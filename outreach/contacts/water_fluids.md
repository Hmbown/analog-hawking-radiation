## Why This Category Matters

Water-wave experiments provide:
1. **Direct experimental validation** of analogue Hawking theory
2. **Visual accessibility** - results are easier to interpret
3. **Controlled parameters** - can tune system properties
4. **Established community** with strong theoretical backing
5. **Benchmark for universality** - can test if κ-normalized collapse holds across platforms

**Strategic Importance**: High. Water-wave researchers are excellent first contacts because they understand both theoretical foundations and experimental realities. Their feedback on diagnostics and universality claims will be invaluable for establishing credibility.
