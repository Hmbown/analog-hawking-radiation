## Why This Category Matters

Optical experiments provide:
1. **Ultrafast timescales** - access to rapid horizon formation
2. **Precise control** - can tune media properties dynamically
3. **Advanced diagnostics** - femtosecond temporal resolution
4. **Negative-frequency components** - unique signature of horizon physics
5. **Quantum optics access** - can study quantum aspects directly

**Strategic Importance**: Medium-high. Optical analogues offer unique experimental capabilities, especially for studying temporal evolution and frequency conversion. The negative-frequency radiation aspect directly connects to our graybody analysis.

**Key Value Proposition**: Provide quantitative predictions for optical systems that include frequency conversion effects. Show how graybody analysis can guide optical diagnostic design.
