## Why This Category Matters

Theory researchers provide:
1. **Conceptual validation** - ensure we haven't missed fundamental issues
2. **Robustness assessment** - identify assumptions that need testing
3. **Standard of proof** - understand what counts as convincing evidence
4. **Theoretical context** - connect our work to broader theoretical landscape
5. **Community credibility** - their endorsement carries weight

**Strategic Importance**: High for long-term credibility. Theory validation is crucial before making strong claims. However, these researchers are less likely to engage with "citizen scientist" efforts, so focus on providing rigorous, well-documented results that speak for themselves.

**Key Value Proposition**: Offer to validate our theoretical assumptions against their published work. Ask for guidance on the most important theoretical issues to address. Seek feedback on conceptual framing and claims.
