## Why This Category Matters

BEC experiments provide:
1. **Quantum regime access** - true quantum Hawking radiation
2. **Unparalleled measurement precision** - can resolve individual phonon modes
3. **Direct parameter control** - know flow profiles, temperatures
4. **Established analysis methods** - PSD analysis is standard practice
5. **Theoretical validation** - can test against many-body quantum theory

**Strategic Importance**: Critical. BEC researchers are the gold standard for experimental analogue Hawking radiation. Their validation of our methods would carry enormous weight in the community. Even negative feedback would be valuable for improving methodology.

**Key Value Proposition**: Offer to apply our analysis pipeline to publicly available BEC experimental data and compare results with published κ values and PSD analyses.
