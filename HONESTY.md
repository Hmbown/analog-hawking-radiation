# Project Honesty & AI Transparency Report

## What Actually Happened (October 2025)

This repository was developed with significant AI assistance. Here's the unvarnished truth:

**Development Process:**
- Core physics algorithms: Human-designed (Hunter Bown)
- Documentation: ~60% AI-generated (Claude, Gemini) but manually reviewed
- Tests: ~40% AI-generated (Copilot) with human oversight
- Boilerplate & CI: Mostly AI-generated, human-tuned

**The "AI Contributor" Situation:**
- AI tools (Copilot, Claude, Gemini Code Assist) made commits under their own names
- This was done for transparency: better to show AI involvement than hide it
- We consider AI as sophisticated development tools, not collaborators
- We do NOT meet ICMJE authorship criteria for AI tools

**What "Cleanup" Means:**
- ✅ Removed AI mentions from README, docs, and status files
- ✅ Deleted documents that listed AI as co-authors
- ❌ Did NOT rewrite git history (commit hashes preserved)
- ❌ Did NOT delete AI-authored commits (history intact)
- ❌ GitHub API still shows AI contributors (this is accurate historical record)

**Why Keep History?**
- Rewriting git history is destructive and breaks forks/clones
- The commits are real; the AI usage is real; why pretend otherwise?
- Academic integrity means accurate record-keeping, not sanitizing the past

**Our Position:**
We believe AI coding assistants are tools—like advanced IDEs or compilers.
Listing them as "contributors" in GitHub's API is a technical artifact of how
GitHub tracks commits, not an academic claim of co-authorship.

If you disagree, we welcome discussion in GitHub Issues.

## How to Cite This Work

**As a software tool:**
Cite Hunter Bown as the author. AI tools are mentioned in the methods section only.

**Example citation:**
Bown, H. (2025). Analog Hawking Radiation Simulator (v0.3.1-alpha).
GitHub. https://github.com/Hmbown/analog-hawking-radiation

**In your methods section:**
"Analyses were performed using the Analog Hawking Radiation Simulator (Bown, 2025),
a research prototype developed with AI coding assistant support. See HONESTY.md for
detailed AI usage disclosure."

## Validation Status (Brutally Honest)

❌ NOT validated against ELI or other experimental facilities
✅ Unit tests pass (testing logic, not physics accuracy)
✅ Physics equations match literature (Chen & Mourou 2017)
⚠️ Numerical convergence not benchmarked against commercial codes
⚠️ Uncertainty propagation not audited by domain expert

**Seeking:** Experimental plasma physicist for validation partnership.
