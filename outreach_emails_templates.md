## Template 1: BEC Analog Black Holes (Jeff Steinhauer, Sebastian Eggert)

**Subject:** Collaboration Opportunity: Computational Prediction of Spatial Coupling Effects in BEC Analog Black Holes

Dear Professor [Last Name],

I hope this email finds you well. My name is [Your Name], and I am a researcher working on computational models of analog Hawking radiation. I am writing to you because of your pioneering work on Bose-Einstein condensate analog black holes, particularly your [specific paper reference, e.g., 2016 Nature Physics paper on quantum Hawking radiation observation].

We have recently identified a potential enhancement in Hawking radiation predictions that may be particularly relevant to your experimental system. Our computational analysis suggests that preserving spatial variation in surface gravity (κ) across the horizon, rather than using averaged values, leads to significantly different predictions for the emitted radiation spectrum.

**Key Finding:** For typical BEC analog configurations, our spatial coupling method predicts peak κ values 1.5-3.0× higher than traditional averaged approaches. This enhancement emerges naturally from the spatial structure of the horizon region.

**Why This Matters for Your Work:**
- Your high-resolution density and velocity measurements provide exactly the spatial information needed to test this prediction
- The enhancement could affect interpretations of Hawking temperature measurements
- Spatially resolved calculations may better capture horizon structure effects

**What We Offer:**
- Computational predictions for your experimental configurations using both methods
- Systematic parameter space exploration to identify optimal detection regimes
- Full uncertainty quantification and statistical analysis
- Co-authorship on resulting publications

**What We Request:**
- Access to published (or new) experimental profiles of your horizon region
- Collaboration on interpreting computational vs experimental results
- Feedback on experimental constraints and realistic parameters

I have prepared a detailed technical summary of our methodology and preliminary results, which I would be happy to share. Would you be available for a brief video call in the next few weeks to discuss this potential collaboration?

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

## Template 2: Fiber Optic Analogs (Daniele Faccio, Ulf Leonhardt)

**Subject:** Computational Modeling Collaboration: Spatial Coupling Effects in Fiber-Optic Analog Horizons

Dear Professor [Last Name],

I am writing to you regarding a computational discovery that may be relevant to your fiber-optic analog event horizon experiments. Having followed your excellent work on [specific paper, e.g., Science 2008 on fiber-optical analog of event horizon], I believe our recent findings could provide new insights into your experimental results.

**Our Discovery:**
We have developed an enhanced computational method that preserves spatial variation in surface gravity across analog horizons. Preliminary results show that this spatial coupling approach predicts significantly different Hawking radiation spectra compared to traditional averaged calculations (1.5-3.0× enhancement in peak surface gravity).

**Connection to Your Work:**
Your fiber-optic experiments provide ideal test cases for this enhancement because:
- High spatial resolution of pulse intensity profiles
- Well-characterized nonlinear refractive index changes
- Direct measurements of frequency shifts (analogous to Hawking radiation)
- Excellent signal-to-noise for spectral measurements

**Proposed Collaboration:**
1. We generate predictions for your experimental configurations using both methods
2. Compare computational spectra with your measured frequency shifts
3. Determine if spatial coupling better explains experimental observations
4. Map parameter regimes where enhancement is most significant

**Our Contribution:**
- Complete computational pipeline for both averaged and spatial coupling methods
- Uncertainty quantification via bootstrap/Monte Carlo methods
- Parameter space mapping across experimental regimes
- Full code and methodology transparency

**Your Contribution:**
- Experimental profiles of pulse propagation (published or new)
- Measured frequency shift spectra
- Experimental constraints and parameter ranges
- Expert interpretation of results

This collaboration could provide the first experimental validation of spatial coupling effects in analog gravity and potentially explain previously unexplained features in analog Hawking radiation measurements.

I have attached a brief technical overview of our methodology. Would you be interested in discussing this further via video call in the coming weeks?

Thank you for considering this collaboration opportunity.

## Template 3: Water Tank Analogs (Silke Weinfurtner, Germain Rousseaux)

**Subject:** Collaboration Proposal: Testing Spatial Coupling Effects in Hydrodynamic Analog Black Holes

Dear Professor [Last Name],

I am contacting you regarding a computational result that may be directly testable in your hydrodynamic analog gravity experiments. Having admired your elegant water tank analog black hole experiments [reference specific paper, e.g., PRL 2011 on stimulated Hawking emission], I believe our recent computational enhancement could be validated using your experimental system.

**Computational Finding:**
Our enhanced Hawking radiation calculations, which preserve spatial variation in surface gravity across the horizon rather than using averaged values, predict surface gravity enhancements of 1.5-3.0× compared to traditional methods. This effect emerges from the spatial structure of the horizon region.

**Why Your Experiments Are Ideal:**
Your water tank analogs are particularly well-suited for testing this prediction because:
- Direct visualization and measurement of surface height profiles
- Precise control over flow velocity and gradient steepness
- Ability to systematically vary parameters
- Previous experience with gradient catastrophe analysis
- Excellent spatial resolution of the horizon region

**Proposed Collaboration Structure:**

**Phase 1 - Analysis of Existing Data:**
- Apply our spatial coupling method to your published horizon profiles
- Generate predictions for Hawking radiation spectra
- Compare with your existing measurements
- Establish baseline for enhancement detection

**Phase 2 - Targeted Experiments (if Phase 1 shows promise):**
- Design experiments to maximize spatial coupling effects
- Systematically vary gradient steepness and flow parameters
- Map enhancement factor across parameter space
- Statistical validation of predictions

**What We Provide:**
- Complete computational pipeline (open source)
- Uncertainty quantification methods
- Parameter space mapping tools
- Full analysis and visualization
- Manuscript preparation support

**What We Seek:**
- Experimental horizon profile data
- Measured wave emission spectra
- Experimental expertise and interpretation
- Co-authorship on resulting publications

**Timeline:** We are flexible and can work within your experimental schedule. Even analysis of existing published data would be extremely valuable.

I have prepared a detailed technical document explaining our methodology and would be delighted to discuss this further with you. Would you be available for a brief call in the next few weeks?

Thank you for your consideration. Your experimental expertise would be invaluable in validating (or refuting) this computational prediction.

## Template 4: Follow-up Email (if no response after 2 weeks)

**Subject:** Following up: Collaboration on Analog Hawking Radiation Enhancement

Dear Professor [Last Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to follow up on my previous message from [date] regarding a potential collaboration on testing spatial coupling effects in analog Hawking radiation experiments.

I understand you are likely very busy, so I'll briefly restate the key points:

**Quick Summary:**
- We found computationally that preserving spatial variation in surface gravity across the horizon predicts 1.5-3.0× higher Hawking radiation than averaged methods
- This is testable with spatially-resolved experimental measurements like those in your [specific paper]
- We provide complete computational predictions; you provide experimental expertise
- Result would be a joint publication validating (or refuting) a fundamental computational prediction

**Time Commitment:** We can start with analysis of your existing published data (minimal time commitment) and only proceed to new experiments if initial results are promising.

If you're not the right person to contact about this, could you please direct me to a colleague or student who might be interested?

Thank you for your time, and I hope to hear from you soon.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
