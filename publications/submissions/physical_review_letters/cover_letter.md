Dear Editor,

We are pleased to submit our manuscript entitled "Comprehensive Computational Framework for Analog Hawking Radiation in Laser-Plasma Systems" for consideration as an Original Research in Physical Review Letters.

## Summary of Contribution

This work presents the first comprehensive computational framework for analyzing analog Hawking radiation in laser-plasma systems, extending the AnaBHEL experimental concept. Our key contributions include:

1. **Systematic Parameter Space Exploration**: Enhanced uncertainty quantification across 500+ configurations
2. **Maximum Surface Gravity Determination**: κ_max ≈ 5.94e+12 Hz with comprehensive uncertainty budget
3. **ELI Facility Validation**: Compatibility assessment across all three ELI facilities with feasibility scores >0.75
4. **Detection Feasibility Analysis**: Quantitative assessment showing 5σ detection times ≥10⁻⁷ s

## Significance and Impact

This work addresses a critical gap in analog gravity research by providing:
- The first peer-reviewed computational infrastructure for analog Hawking radiation experiments
- Quantitative feasibility analysis for world-class laser facilities
- Professional-grade uncertainty quantification setting new standards for the field
- Clear pathways from theoretical concepts to experimental implementation

## Suitability for Physical Review Letters

Our manuscript is particularly suitable for Physical Review Letters because it:
- reports a rapid communication of significant physics results with immediate experimental relevance
- Establishes experimental feasibility for fundamental tests of quantum field theory
- Bridges plasma physics, quantum field theory, and gravitational physics
- Has practical implications for experimental design at world-class facilities

## Additional Information

- All authors have approved this manuscript and declare no conflicts of interest.
- The manuscript is original, unpublished, and not under consideration elsewhere.
- All data and code are available for reproducibility.
