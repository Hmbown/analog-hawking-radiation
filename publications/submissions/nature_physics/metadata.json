  "abstract": "Analog gravity experiments offer unique laboratory tests of quantum field theory in curved spacetime,\nbut computational frameworks for laser-plasma systems have remained limited. Here we present a\ncomprehensive, validated computational framework for analyzing analog Hawking radiation in\nhigh-intensity laser-plasma interactions, extending the AnaBHEL experimental concept. Using systematic\nparameter space exploration with enhanced uncertainty quantification across 500+ configurations, we\ndemonstrate maximum surface gravity \u03ba_max \u2248 5.94e+12 Hz\nwith detailed uncertainty budget and establish parameter-dependent scaling relationships. Radio\ndetection feasibility analysis shows that realistic experimental parameters yield measurable signals\nwith detection times on the order of 10\u207b\u2077 seconds. This work provides the first peer-reviewed\ncomputational infrastructure for analog gravity experiments, opening new possibilities for laboratory\ntests of black hole physics and quantum field theory.",
