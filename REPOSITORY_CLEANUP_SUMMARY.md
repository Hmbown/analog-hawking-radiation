# Repository Cleanup and Preparation Summary

**Date**: October 2025
**Version**: 0.1.0
**Status**: Ready for Public Release

## Overview

Systematic cleanup and organization of the analog-hawking-radiation repository completed. All critical issues resolved, documentation restructured for scientific clarity, and validation testing confirmed functional.

## Changes Completed

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes

**Metadata Corrections**:
- Verified GitHub repository URL correct in setup.py (https://github.com/hmbown/analog-hawking-radiation)
- Email addresses confirmed consistent across all files (hunter@shannonlabs.dev)
- Version 0.1.0 verified across setup.py, pyproject.toml, CITATION.cff, __init__.py, README.md

**Fictional Content Removal**:
- Deleted docs/launch_readiness_plan.md (contained fictional team members and dates)
- Completely rewrote TESTING_PLAN.md to remove fictional roles and provide scientific validation framework
- All documentation now reflects actual project status

### Phase 2: Repository Pruning

**Removed Incomplete Features**:
- Deleted docs/source/ directory (12 RST files, incomplete Sphinx documentation with no build system)
- Removed docs/archive/ (empty directory)
- Total files removed: 14+ documentation files that added no value

**Build Artifacts and External Copies**:
- Added `.gitignore` rules for `paper/build_arxiv/` and `paper/arxiv_package.zip`
- Removed external paper copies from repository root (`AnaBHEL_Analog_Black_Hole_Evaporation_via_Lasers_E.md`, `2e3e73de-bed2-41a2-b74b-a00678c80cd1.md`)
- Note: `paper/build_arxiv/` binary outputs (PDF/PNG duplicates) are now ignored going forward; existing tracked binaries can be purged in a follow-up commit if desired

**Script Organization**:
- Moved scripts/experiments/ → scripts/archive_exploratory/ (7 experimental scripts)
- Created comprehensive scripts/README.md documenting all 28+ scripts and their purposes
- Clear distinction between core analysis workflows and exploratory development scripts

### Phase 3: Documentation Restructuring

**README.md Complete Restructure**:

Previous structure had 4 overlapping introduction sections with significant repetition. New structure follows scientific paper format:

1. **Abstract** (3-4 sentences) - Concise framework summary
2. **Physical System & Governing Equations** - All formulas explicitly stated with units:
   - Horizon condition: |v(x)| = c_s(x)
   - Surface gravity: κ = 0.5|d/dx(|v| - c_s)|
   - Hawking temperature: T_H = ℏκ/(2πk_B)
   - Plasma parameters: ω_p, a_0, c_s with full definitions
   - Hawking spectrum: Planck's law with graybody corrections

3. **Computational Methods** - Horizon detection, graybody modeling, multi-beam superposition, radio SNR analysis

4. **Validation** - Analytical comparisons, numerical verification, test suite reference

5. **Key Results** - All figures and quantitative findings with data file references

6. **Installation and Usage** - Complete practical guide maintained

7. **Limitations and Uncertainties** (NEW - Prominent Section):
   - Computational approximations (PIC validation gap, WarpX status)
   - Physical model limitations (sound speed profiles, magnetized effects)
   - Graybody transmission uncertainties
   - Detection model assumptions
   - Experimental validation gap
   - Formation probability uncertainties
   - Absolute vs. relative predictions

8. **Technical Glossary** (NEW) - All specialized terms defined:
   - κ, T_H, c_s, a_0, v(x), graybody, ponderomotive, ω_p, WKB, envelope-scale, etc.

9. **Recommended Experimental Strategies** - Maintained practical guidance

10. **Citation** - BibTeX format provided

**Key Improvements**:
- Eliminated redundancy: 4 overlapping sections consolidated into 2 clear sections
- Equations made explicit: All governing equations with variable definitions and units
- Limitations highly visible: Comprehensive standalone section replacing scattered mentions
- No new content added: Only restructured existing information
- Scientific rigor maintained: All technical details preserved

### Phase 4: Validation Testing

**Test Suite Status**:
- All 23 tests pass (pytest tests/)
  - 11 integration tests pass
  - 12 unit tests pass covering core physics
- Core scripts verified functional:
  - python scripts/run_full_pipeline.py --demo ✓
  - python scripts/compute_formation_frontier.py ✓
  - make figures ✓
  - make validate ✓

**Test Coverage**:
- Horizon detection against analytical solutions
- Graybody transmission calculations
- Planck distribution Rayleigh-Jeans limit
- Radiometer equation sanity checks
- Adaptive sigma smoothing
- Frequency gating boundary conditions
- Module integration and data flow

### Phase 5: Final Documentation

**Updated Release Checklist** (PUBLIC_RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md):
- All critical items marked complete
- Repository configuration verified
