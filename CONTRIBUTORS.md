# Contributors

## Lead Developer
- **Hunter Bown** - Independent Researcher
  - Project conception, core physics implementation, validation framework
  - Email: hunterbown@example.com

## Acknowledgments

This project uses physics concepts developed by:
- **Pisin Chen & Gérard Mourou** - Original analog Hawking radiation concept in laser-plasma systems

## Contribution Policy

**This project is seeking domain expert collaborators:**

We need:
- Experimental plasma physicists with ELI facility access
- PIC code experts (OSIRIS, WarpX) for integration
- Theoretical physicists to audit sonic horizon approximations
- Peer reviewers for uncertainty propagation validation

**AI tools were used in code generation** (Claude, GitHub Copilot) but all scientific decisions, physics validation, and architectural choices were made by the lead developer. AI contributions are not listed as co-authors as they are tools, not collaborators.

## How to Contribute

1. Open an issue describing your expertise and proposed contribution
2. For code contributions: Submit PRs with physics justification and test coverage
3. For experimental validation: Contact directly for collaboration agreement
4. For peer review: Request access to validation notebooks and methodology docs

## No AI Contributors

Consistent with academic authorship standards, only humans who have made substantial intellectual contributions to the physics, methodology, or validation are listed as contributors. AI assistants are acknowledged as tools in this documentation but are not authors.
