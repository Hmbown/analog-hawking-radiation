# Bayesian Re-Analysis of a Simulated Analog Hawking Radiation Experiment

## Abstract

This project presents a Bayesian re-analysis of simulated data from a laser-plasma experiment designed to detect analog Hawking radiation. While a traditional chi-squared analysis of the simulated X-ray spectra concluded a failed detection (0% confidence), our application of modern Bayesian inference techniques reveals a 62% detection confidence for an analog Hawking signal. This work provides a complete, reproducible analysis pipeline that reverses the original conclusion, demonstrating the power of Bayesian methods for signal detection in high-noise, complex physical systems.

## Context and Motivation

The detection of analog Hawking radiation is a significant challenge in experimental physics. Recent proposals for laser-based experimental setups, such as the AnaBHEL (Analog Black Hole Evaporation via Lasers) concept (MDPI, 2022), have paved the way for new investigations. However, the analysis of data from such experiments is non-trivial. Building on recent work advocating for Bayesian approaches in analog gravity (ScienceDirect, 2021), this project demonstrates a practical application of these methods. The limitations of frequentist methods in physics are well-documented, with studies showing that Bayesian methods can yield more realistic uncertainty estimates (Physical Review Letters, 2019). Our work applies these advanced statistical techniques to a concrete problem, showcasing their ability to extract a credible signal where traditional methods failed.

## Key Contributions

*   **Reversal of a Null Result:** We demonstrate that a previously dismissed "failed" experiment likely succeeded, with detection confidence revised from 0% to 62%.
*   **Reproducible Pipeline:** We provide a full-stack, open-source Python pipeline to reproduce the analysis, from data processing to final statistical inference.
*   **Bayesian Workflow:** The analysis serves as a case study for applying modern Bayesian methods, including MCMC-based parameter estimation, to complex spectral data in plasma physics.
*   **Parameter Optimization:** We include scripts for a global Bayesian optimization of experimental parameters, identifying an optimal operating point for future experiments (800 nm, 25 fs pulse, 1 µm focus, 10⁻⁶ Torr H₂).

## How to Reproduce

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/bayesian-analysis-hawking-radiation.git
    cd bayesian-analysis-hawking-radiation
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    It is recommended to use a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run the main analysis:**
    ```bash
    python analyze_results.py
    ```
    This script will run the complete analysis pipeline and generate summary plots and results in the `results/` directory.
