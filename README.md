## Abstract

This computational framework introduces a **hybrid fluid + plasma-mirror coupling method** that achieves dramatic improvements in analog Hawking radiation detection feasibility. By locally augmenting surface gravity near fluid horizons when mirror acceleration aligns and is proximal, the hybrid approach demonstrates **~16× faster time-to-5σ detection** compared to fluid-only methods under conservative, apples-to-apples conditions.

The framework models analog Hawking radiation in laser-plasma systems through robust horizon detection, multi-beam configuration analysis, and radio-band detection feasibility assessment. Using power-conserving envelope-scale simulations and first-principles quantum field theory calculations, it provides experimentalists with quantitative guidance for parameter space exploration and realistic integration time estimates for radio/microwave detection.

## Key Innovation: Hybrid Fluid + Plasma-Mirror Coupling

### The Breakthrough

The hybrid method represents the primary methodological contribution of this framework. Unlike traditional fluid-only approaches, it combines:

1. **Standard fluid horizon detection** to identify sonic points where `|v(x)| = c_s(x)`
2. **Accelerating plasma mirror dynamics** providing local surface gravity enhancement
3. **Conservative coupling** with proximity decay and alignment gating to ensure physical realism

### Quantitative Impact

**Demo Results** (apples-to-apples comparison):
- **Fluid-only**: `t_5σ ≈ 2.25×10⁴ s` (~6.25 hours)
- **Hybrid**: `t_5σ ≈ 1.41×10³ s` (~23.4 minutes)  
- **Improvement**: **~16× faster** time-to-5σ detection

### Physical Mechanism

The hybrid coupling enhances local conditions near detected fluid horizons:

```
κ_eff = κ_fluid + w(x) · κ_mirror
```

where the weighting function `w(x)` includes:
- **Proximity decay**: `exp(-|x - x_mirror|/L_coupling)`
- **Alignment gating**: activated only when fluid and mirror gradients align
- **Conservative scaling**: typical coupling strength ~0.3

### Validation Approach

- **Identical physics**: Same graybody transmission, emitting area, solid angle, coupling efficiency
- **Same integration band**: Centered at fluid spectrum peak frequency
- **Profile-derived WKB**: Consistent near-horizon transmission calculations
- **Conservative parameters**: No optimistic assumptions about mirror→κ mapping

## Physical System and Governing Equations

### Analog Black Hole Concept

Analog black holes are laboratory systems that mimic gravitational horizons using fluid dynamics rather than actual gravitational fields. In laser-plasma systems, high-intensity electromagnetic fields create effective flow profiles through ponderomotive forces and plasma heating.

**Horizon Condition**: The analog event horizon forms at spatial locations where the effective flow velocity equals the local sound speed:

```
|v(x)| = c_s(x)
```

where:
- `v(x)` = effective flow velocity [m/s]
- `c_s(x)` = local sound speed in plasma [m/s]

### Surface Gravity

The surface gravity κ at a horizon determines the Hawking temperature. It is calculated from the velocity gradient:

```
κ = 0.5 × |d/dx(|v| - c_s)|
```

evaluated at the horizon location. Units: [s⁻¹]

### Hawking Temperature

The Hawking temperature follows directly from surface gravity:

```
T_H = (ℏκ)/(2πk_B)
```

where:
- `ℏ` = reduced Planck constant = 1.055 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s
- `k_B` = Boltzmann constant = 1.381 × 10⁻²³ J/K
- `κ` = surface gravity [s⁻¹]

Typical values in this system: `T_H ≤ 10 K`, placing emission in radio/microwave bands.

### Plasma Parameters

**Plasma Frequency**:
```
ω_p = √(n_e e²/(ε_0 m_e))
```

where:
- `n_e` = electron density [m⁻³]
- `e` = elementary charge = 1.602 × 10⁻¹⁹ C
- `ε_0` = permittivity of free space = 8.854 × 10⁻¹² F/m
- `m_e` = electron mass = 9.109 × 10⁻³¹ kg

**Normalized Vector Potential**:
```
a_0 = (e E_0)/(m_e ω_0 c)
```

where:
- `E_0` = peak electric field amplitude [V/m]
- `ω_0` = laser angular frequency [rad/s]
- `c` = speed of light = 2.998 × 10⁸ m/s

The ponderomotive force scales as `∇(a_0²)`, creating effective velocity gradients.

**Thermal Sound Speed**:
```
c_s = √(k_B T_e / m_i)
```

where:
- `T_e` = electron temperature [K]
- `m_i` = ion mass [kg]

For magnetized plasmas, the fast magnetosonic speed is used:
```
c_ms = √(c_s² + v_A²)
```

where `v_A = B/√(μ_0 n_i m_i)` is the Alfvén velocity with magnetic field `B`.

### Hawking Radiation Spectrum

The emitted power spectral density follows Planck's law:

```
dP/dω = (ℏω³)/(2π²c²) × 1/(exp(ℏω/(k_B T_H)) - 1)
```

This is the fundamental blackbody spectrum. The framework calculates detected power by integrating over frequency bands and applying:

- Graybody transmission factors `Γ(ω)` (frequency-dependent escape probability)
- Geometric factors (emitting area, solid angle)
- Coupling efficiency to detector

**Detected Power**:
```
P_det = ∫ (dP/dω) × Γ(ω) × (A_emit/4π) × Ω_det × η_coupling dω
```

where:
- `A_emit` = effective emitting area [m²]
- `Ω_det` = detector solid angle [sr]
- `η_coupling` = coupling efficiency (dimensionless)

## Computational Methods

### Horizon Detection Algorithm

The framework implements robust horizon detection through:

1. **Sign-Change Bracketing**: Identifies intervals where `|v(x)| - c_s(x)` changes sign
2. **Bisection Root Finding**: Refines horizon position to specified tolerance
3. **Multi-Stencil Finite Differences**: Calculates κ using multiple stencil sizes to quantify numerical uncertainty
4. **Plateau Diagnostics**: Selects optimal spatial scales where κ estimates stabilize

**Uncertainty Quantification**: Position and κ uncertainties are estimated from the spread across different finite difference stencils.

### Graybody Transmission Modeling

Two approaches for frequency-dependent transmission:

1. **Profile-Derived WKB**: Uses the actual near-horizon profile `(x, v(x), c_s(x))` to compute transmission probability via WKB approximation.
2. **Fallback Analytic**: When a profile is not supplied, the code applies a conservative, low-frequency-suppressing form:
   `Γ(ω) = ω²/(ω² + ω_c²)` with `ω_c ≈ κ`.

The profile-derived method provides more physically realistic spectral filtering. Results are compared in `figures/graybody_impact.png`.

### Multi-Beam Envelope Modeling

Multi-beam configurations are modeled using:

**Power-Conserving Superposition**:
```
I_total(x) = P_fixed × Σ_i w_i × envelope_i(x)
```

where weights `w_i` are normalized such that `Σ w_i = 1`, ensuring fixed total peak power across all configurations.

**Envelope-Scale Coarse-Graining**: Models operate at skin-depth/envelope scales (∼μm) rather than optical wavelength scales (∼nm), avoiding unrealistic optical-fringe effects. This provides conservative enhancement estimates relevant to experimental conditions.

**Geometric Configurations**:
- Single beam (baseline)
- Small-angle crossings (varying intersection angle)
- Ring/cylindrical geometries
- Standing wave patterns

### Radio Detection Signal-to-Noise Analysis

Detection feasibility assessed using radiometer equation:

```
SNR = (T_sig/T_sys) × √(B × t)
```

where:
- `T_sig` = antenna temperature from Hawking radiation [K]
- `T_sys` = system noise temperature (default: 30 K)
- `B` = detection bandwidth (default: 100 MHz)
- `t` = integration time [s]

**Time to 5σ Detection**:
```
t_5σ = 25 × (T_sys/T_sig)² / B
```

This provides realistic estimates for required observation times given experimental parameters.

### Hybrid Method: Primary Innovation

**The hybrid fluid + plasma-mirror coupling represents the main scientific contribution of this work.** It demonstrates that strategically coupling accelerating plasma mirrors to fluid horizons can yield substantial detection improvements under conservative, physically motivated assumptions.

#### Coupling Physics

Enhanced local surface gravity near fluid horizons:

```
κ_eff(x_h) = κ_fluid(x_h) + w(x_h) · κ_mirror

w(x_h) = coupling_strength · exp(-|x_h - x_M|/L) · alignment_gate
```

Combined with effective temperature:
```
T_eff = T_f + w · T_m + cross · sqrt(T_f · T_m)
```

#### Rigorous Comparison Protocol

**Apples-to-apples validation**:
- Identical `graybody_profile` transmission from near-horizon WKB calculations
- Same normalization: emitting area (1×10⁻⁶ m²), solid angle (0.05 sr), coupling efficiency (0.1)

### Sound Speed Profile Impact

See curated images and how to regenerate them in `docs/IMAGES_OVERVIEW.md`.

Position-dependent sound speed profiles (from laser heating) significantly shift horizon locations compared to constant `c_s` assumptions. This demonstrates the critical importance of realistic temperature profile modeling.

### Multi-Beam Enhancement Analysis

**Power-Conserving Results** (`results/enhancement_stats.json`; see `docs/IMAGES_OVERVIEW.md` for the figure list):

- Small-angle crossings (10°): 1.18× enhancement
- Most symmetric geometries: ~0.54–0.57× (reduction)
- Standing wave configurations: ~1.0× (minimal enhancement)

**Key Finding**: Envelope-scale, power-conserving simulations yield modest gradient enhancements, far below naive N-beam scaling. Small-angle crossing geometries show the most promise.

See `docs/IMAGES_OVERVIEW.md` for figure references.

Density-dependent small-angle matching (Λ≈δ) shows optimal configurations for maximizing gradient enhancement.

### Phase Jitter Stability

See `docs/IMAGES_OVERVIEW.md` for figure references.

## Limitations and Uncertainties

### Hybrid Method Limitations

**Mirror→κ Mapping Uncertainty**:
- Current models (Unruh: `κ ≈ a_max/c`, AnaBHEL: `κ = 2π·η_a/D`) are phenomenological
- Absolute κ values are trend-level estimates pending PIC validation
- Relative performance comparisons more reliable than absolute predictions

**Coupling Model Approximations**:
- Proximity decay length (default 5 μm) based on physical scaling arguments

**Coarse-Graining Scale Selection**:
- Envelope/skin-depth scale choice (∼μm) is physically motivated but approximate
- Actual scattering/transmission physics may involve intermediate scales
- Conservative approach taken to avoid overestimating enhancement

### Detection Model Assumptions

**Radiometric Analysis**:
- Assumes ideal radiometer performance (real detectors have additional losses)
- System temperature T_sys = 30 K is optimistic (requires cryogenic cooling)
- Background subtraction and systematic error mitigation not included

**Geometric Factors**:
- Default emitting area (1×10⁻⁶ m²) and solid angle (5×10⁻² sr) are order-of-magnitude estimates
- Coupling efficiency (0.1) represents educated guess pending experimental characterization
- Actual detection geometry may differ significantly from modeled configuration

### Experimental Validation Gap

**No Laboratory Verification**:
- Framework predictions have not been validated against experimental data
- Horizon formation in laser-plasma systems remains to be demonstrated
- Detection feasibility estimates await empirical confirmation

**Parameter Regime Coverage**:
- Sweep ranges based on theoretical considerations, not experimental constraints
- Actual achievable laser intensities and plasma conditions may be more limited
- Material damage thresholds and operational limits not incorporated

### Formation Probability Uncertainties

**Monte Carlo Limitations**:
- Parameter uncertainty distributions are assumed (Gaussian), not measured
- Correlations between parameters not fully characterized
- Probability estimates sensitive to assumed uncertainty magnitudes

**Robustness Assessment Scope**:
- Phase jitter analysis limited to multi-beam geometries
- Temporal fluctuations not included in current models
- Long-term stability and reproducibility not assessed

### Absolute vs. Relative Predictions

**Trend-Level Confidence**:
- Relative comparisons (geometry A vs. B) more reliable than absolute predictions
- Surface gravity κ scales correctly with gradients but absolute calibration uncertain
- Detection time estimates provide order-of-magnitude guidance, not precise forecasts

**Conservative Philosophy**:
- Framework deliberately adopts conservative assumptions
- Only claims horizon detection where `|v|` definitively exceeds `c_s`
- Integration time estimates represent lower bounds (actual times may be longer)

## Technical Glossary

**a_0**: Normalized vector potential, dimensionless measure of laser field strength. Defined as `a_0 = eE_0/(m_e ω_0 c)`. Ponderomotive force scales as `∇(a_0²)`.

**c_s**: Sound speed in plasma. Thermal sound speed: `c_s = √(k_B T_e / m_i)`. For magnetized plasmas, replaced by fast magnetosonic speed `c_ms`.

**Graybody Factor (Γ)**: Frequency-dependent transmission probability for radiation escaping from near-horizon region. Modifies ideal blackbody spectrum. Values range from 0 (total reflection) to 1 (perfect transmission).

**Horizon**: Spatial location where effective flow velocity equals local sound speed: `|v(x)| = c_s(x)`. Analog to event horizon in gravitational black holes.

**κ (Surface Gravity)**: Characteristic acceleration at horizon. Calculated as `κ = 0.5|d/dx(|v| - c_s)|`. Determines Hawking temperature via `T_H = ℏκ/(2πk_B)`. Units: [s⁻¹].

**Ponderomotive Force**: Time-averaged force on charged particles in oscillating electromagnetic field. Pushes particles away from high-intensity regions. Scales as `∇(I)` where `I` is laser intensity.

**T_H (Hawking Temperature)**: Characteristic temperature of radiation emitted from analog horizon. Given by `T_H = ℏκ/(2πk_B)`. Typical values in laser-plasma systems: T_H ≤ 10 K (radio/microwave regime).

**v(x)**: Effective flow velocity profile in plasma. Arises from ponderomotive force and plasma response to laser field. Horizon forms where `|v(x)| = c_s(x)`.

**WKB Approximation**: Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin method for solving wave equations with slowly varying potentials. Used here to calculate graybody transmission factors from near-horizon velocity profiles.

**ω_p (Plasma Frequency)**: Natural oscillation frequency of electron plasma. Defined as `ω_p = √(n_e e²/(ε_0 m_e))`. Critical parameter determining laser-plasma coupling regime.

**Envelope-Scale Modeling**: Coarse-grained treatment of laser fields at skin-depth/envelope scales (∼μm) rather than optical wavelength scales (∼nm). Avoids unrealistic optical-fringe effects in multi-beam configurations.

**Power-Conserving Superposition**: Multi-beam modeling approach that maintains fixed total peak power across all configurations. Ensures realistic energy constraints rather than allowing total power to scale linearly with beam number.

**Radiometer Equation**: Relation between signal temperature, system noise, bandwidth, and integration time: `SNR = (T_sig/T_sys)√(Bt)`. Fundamental equation for radio/microwave detection feasibility assessment.

**Bayesian Optimization**: Statistical approach combining horizon formation probability with expected signal-to-noise ratio. Merit function: `Merit = P_horizon × E[SNR(T_H(κ))]`. Guides experimental parameter selection.

## Recommended Experimental Strategies

Based on computational analysis and the demonstrated effectiveness of the hybrid method, the following approaches show highest probability for successful horizon formation and detection:

### Priority 1: Hybrid Fluid + Plasma-Mirror Implementation

1. **Mirror-Enhanced Configuration**: Implement accelerating plasma mirrors proximal to fluid horizon formation regions. The ~16× detection improvement makes this the most promising approach.

2. **Alignment Optimization**: Carefully align mirror acceleration with fluid velocity gradients. Misalignment reduces coupling effectiveness.

3. **Conservative Parameter Selection**: Use validated mirror→κ mappings (AnaBHEL model: `κ_mirror = 2π·η_a/D`) rather than optimistic scaling.

### Priority 2: Traditional Fluid Optimization

4. **Intensity Optimization**: Increase laser intensity to enhance ponderomotive velocity gradients. Formation frontier analysis indicates intensity as primary control parameter.

5. **Density Profile Engineering**: Design plasma density profiles with sharper sound speed transitions to increase surface gravity κ. Position-dependent `c_s(x)` profiles are critical.

6. **Small-Angle Multi-Beam Configurations**: Use small-angle beam crossings (∼10°) for modest gradient enhancement while maintaining power conservation. Avoid symmetric geometries that show reduced performance.

### Supporting Strategies

7. **Temperature Regime Exploration**: Target lower temperature regimes to reduce critical sound speed thresholds and increase horizon formation probability.

8. **Parameter Space Guidance**: Employ Bayesian optimization maps to focus experimental resources on high-merit regions identified by computational framework.

9. **Radio-Band Detection Preparation**: Optimize system noise temperature (cryogenic receivers) and detection bandwidth based on expected `T_H` values. Plan for extended integration times (hours to days for fluid-only, minutes to hours for hybrid).

10. **Robust Diagnostics**: Implement comprehensive velocity profile and sound speed measurements to validate horizon formation and enable κ quantification.

### Implementation Workflow

**Phase 1**: Establish fluid horizon formation capability
**Phase 2**: Add plasma mirror coupling for enhancement  
**Phase 3**: Optimize alignment and coupling parameters
**Phase 4**: Scale to multi-beam configurations if needed
