AnaBHEL (Analog Black Hole Evaporation via Lasers) concepts used in this framework.

- Prof. Gerard Mourou (École Polytechnique, IZEST) - Nobel Laureate
- AnaBHEL Collaboration (2022) - "AnaBHEL Experiment: Concept, Design, and Status"

Foundational Theory:

  black hole information loss paradox" - Physical Review Letters 118, 045001

Related Analog Gravity Experts:

- Prof. Jeff Steinhauer (Technion) - First experimental analog Hawking radiation
- Prof. Daniele Faccio (University of Glasgow) - Laser-based analog systems

IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:
====================
This framework explores a SPECULATIVE extension of AnaBHEL concepts by coupling
plasma mirrors with fluid sonic horizons. This hybrid approach goes beyond
established AnaBHEL theory and represents a computational thought experiment
rather than established physics.

The original AnaBHEL work focuses on pure plasma mirror systems, not hybrid
fluid-mirror coupling as explored in this speculative framework.
