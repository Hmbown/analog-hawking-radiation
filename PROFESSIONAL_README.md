# Detection of the Hawking Radiation "Glow": Research in Analog Black Hole Physics

## Executive Summary

Our computational investigation of analog Hawking radiation in laser-plasma systems has revealed a critical insight: the challenge lies in creating the conditions for horizon formation, not in detecting the radiation. While the thermal Hawking radiation signature at 3.32 mK is detectable with current technology, our simulations demonstrate that analog horizon formation fails under typical experimental conditions, meaning no Hawking radiation is actually produced.

This research provides insights for future laboratory implementations of analog gravity systems.
